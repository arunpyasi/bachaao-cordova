            It’s good to know how to defend yourself but the best way to actually use self-defense techniques is to not use them at all. You can avoid a direct confrontation if you don’t look like a suitable victim in the eyes of an attacker. Most low-lives look
            for easy targets that can’t or won’t fight back so make sure you know your surroundings and take all the security precautions necessary. Here are a few basic safety precautions:
            <ul>
                <li>Before approaching your door or your car always make sure to look around and see if there’s no one around.</li>
                <li>Don’t wear expensive jewelry or bags when you travel alone.</li>
                <li>Park your car in a well-lit area and always keep your keys in your hand while walking to the car. If you stop right beside the car and start looking for keys in your purse your attention is distracted and you might miss someone sneaking
                    behind you. If you keep the keys in your hand you’ll be able to unlock your car and get in quickly.</li>
                <li>Don’t walk alone on a dark alley, late at night. Darkness is the best hiding place for this kind of people.</li>
                <li>Don’t be predictable! Try to take different routes when walking home or to the store. This discourages someone who is looking for a pattern.</li>
            </ul>
            Sometimes even if you take all the precautions in the world, you might still end up with an attacker in front of you. If this happens try to defuse the situation if you think it’s possible. Even though you may be very scared your brain will still be able
            to quickly assess the situation. The most important thing is to not freeze.

            <img src="./assets/img/image.gif" class="img-rounded"> Try and see if you can talk your attacker out of assaulting you. An attacker that seems unsure, who shakes or shows remorse might be opened to discussion. Also if they only want valuables
            from you it’s better to hand them over rather than fight. If the attacker has a gun don’t even think about it, simply hand over the purse or the wallet. Your life is definitely worth more than what you own at that certain moment in time. If
            there’s no chance of getting out of this without physical confrontation (the attacker touches you or you are sure you won’t get out of this) it’s time to apply a few basic self-defense techniques. Don’t get intimidated by the size of your
            attacker. Even a big man (or woman) has his weak points. The main way to show the attacker you are not an easy target is to react quickly. Don’t let them take you by surprise, instead try to surprise them.
